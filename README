Zend Framework is a powerful tool. Unfortunately, its complexity makes it difficult to start working. I decided to learn the Zend Framework on a specific project. This is how DiscoverPHP.com was created.

On the internet you can find examples of simple or very complex applications. Missing something intermediate. I would like to fill this gap, so I decided to release the source code of DiscoverPHP.com.
